ComandHandler
=============

CommandHandler is a library for Arduino and other Wiring-type
environments to implement command parsing from serial data streams
where characters arrive separately.

The library does not use any dynamic memory allocation. The caller
is required to pass in the buffer required, thereby allowing full
control of the memory used.
